## Overview
Sets an Active Directory user account expiration date.

`Set-UserExpiration` sets the expiration date for one or more Active Directory user accounts. If no date is specified, the account is configured to expire in 90 days. If a date greater than 90 days in the future is provided, the date is automatically capped at 90 days.

Supports pipeline input and `-WhatIf`.

## Parameters

### Date
Optional expiration date.

- Defaults to 90 days from today.
- Dates greater than 90 days in the future are capped at 90 days.

### Server
